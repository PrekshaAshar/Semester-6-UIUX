        <p>The UI/UX course in the last semester saw several elements. The HTML curriculum was streamlined to focus on semantic HTML5 elements, emphasizing accessibility and best practices. CSS instruction was enhanced with a deeper dive into flexbox and grid layouts, providing us with a robust foundation for creating responsive and modern web designs. Furthermore, practical exercises were integrated more frequently, allowing us to apply their knowledge and develop a stronger understanding of UI/UX principles through hands-on experience.</p>

        <h1>Introduction to Net Art</h1>
        <section class="spacing">
        
        <p>Net art, short for "internet art," is a form of digital art that emerged in the 1990s, utilizing the internet as both its medium and venue. Unlike traditional art forms, net art is designed to exist and be experienced online, often exploring themes of interactivity, virtual space, and networked culture. It challenges conventional notions of authorship, audience, and distribution by offering interactive, collaborative, and often ephemeral experiences that blend art with technology.</p>

      <h1>Exercise: Researching Interactive Storytelling Websites</h1>

      <section class="spacing">
        
        <p>The objective of this exercise was to explore how storytelling can be transformed through interactive web-based platforms, focusing on elements such as user engagement, narrative flow, and technological execution. The process involved a detailed analysis of three distinct browser-based storytelling websites, examining how they employed interactivity to enhance their narrative experiences.</p>

        <p>During the research phase, the purpose, functionality, message, and intentions of each website were critically evaluated. Additionally, the creators' backgrounds and the context of their creation were explored, providing insight into their creative processes. A significant emphasis was placed on understanding the technologies utilized, including HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and WebGL, to identify how these tools contributed to the overall user experience. </p>

        <p>From this research, several key insights emerged. Websites with minimalist designs effectively directed the user's attention to the narrative. Subtle animations and hover effects were identified as powerful tools to create immersion, while non-linear navigation made the experience feel more personalized and dynamic, allowing users to shape the story actively.</p>

        <p>
          The user takes on the role of an observer, experiencing the story through a scroll-based interactive animation. The narrative follows a young Palestinian boy during wartime, depicting the slow collapse of his world as the war progresses. Through the use of parallax scrolling and animated transitions, the user witnesses his journey—starting with an ordinary day and leading to irreversible loss and displacement.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project ties into the theme of Migration, as it portrays forced displacement due to war, and highlights the impact of violence on innocent civilians. The interactive format immerses users into the child's reality, making them emotionally invested in his story. Main Sections (Scenes)
